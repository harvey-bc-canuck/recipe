# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is a way to check the state of the Git repository. 
It shows which files have changes that are:
1. **staged** (ready to be committed)
2. **unstaged** (modified but not yet added to staging)
3. **untracked** (new files not yet tracked by Git)

`git status` is useful for:
1. Checking which files have been modified since the last commit
2. Identifying any new, untracked files
3. Viewing any merge conflicts that need to be resolved
